5. Choose a folder you want to convert  
6. Click on "New Step"  
7. "Choose an action",type (onedrive), choose "Convert file"  
8. Do not choose the a file you want to convert rather choose Dynamic content--> File identifies, so that all the files in source folder are converted  
9. Target Type as PDF
